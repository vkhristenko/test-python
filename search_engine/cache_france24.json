[" eu commission president ursula von der leyen and britain s prime minister boris johnson agreed on sunday to continue post brexit trade talks in search of an elusive deal in a joint statement that von der leyen read out on eu television the eu commission president said she and mr johnson had a useful phone call and that they had discussed the major unresolved topics after almost a year of negotiations despite the fact that deadlines have been missed over and over we think it is responsible at this point to go the extra mile we have accordingly mandated our negotiators to continue the talks and to see whether an agreement can even at this late stage be reached we had a useful call with this morning we agreed that talks will continue https t co rzpnpmsi sunday is just the latest in a string of supposedly hard deadlines for the negotiations but with britain due to leave the eu single market in days tensions remain on saturday britain took the dramatic step of announcing that armed naval vessels will patrol its waters from january to exclude european crews from the fishing grounds they have shared in some cases for centuries brussels tone has been less bellicose and von der leyen has made it clear that the eu will respect uk sovereignty after the post brexit transition period but neither side is yet ready to compromise on core principles close the door without a trade deal cross channel trade will revert to wto rules with tariffs driving up prices and generating paperwork for importers and the failed negotiation may poison relations between london and brussels for years to come on wednesday after what von der leyen described as a lively and interesting working supper with johnson in brussels failed to find a breakthrough the eu chief said they had agreed to come to a decision by the end of the weekend france s minister for europe clement beaune told the newspaper journal du dimanche that if talks were to be extended again it would only be for a maximum of a few days we re already in extra time he warned in london british foreign secretary dominic raab told sky news he would not yet close the door on chances that the talks continue if the eu can find its way to treat us like a normal independent country i think that the eu is concerned that actually britain might do rather well once we leave the eu and is worried about the competitive advantage even on the normal global rules that apply he said ireland stands to lose more than most eu members in a no deal future with its larger neighbour outside the bloc and irish prime minister micheal martin told the bbc he was still hopeful of a breakthrough no stone unturned martin said percent of an agreement has been negotiated and it seems to me that the remaining three percent should not be beyond the capacity of both sides to bridge the fact that they negotiated into the night is an important sign in itself where the dialogue continues that gives me hope he said much of the text of a possible trade deal is said to be ready but britain has rejected brussels insistence on a mechanism to allow it to retaliate if uk and eu law diverge in a way that puts continental firms at a competitive disadvantage the defence of the single market is a red line for the european union what we have proposed to the united kingdom respects british sovereignty it could be the basis for an agreement a senior eu source said echoing an earlier von der leyen statement in london a government spokesman stressed britain was ready to leave the union and handle its own affairs after years of close economic integration and that as things stand the offer on the table from the eu remains unacceptable the prime minister will leave no stone unturned in this process but he is absolutely clear any agreement must be fair and respect the fundamental position that the uk will be a sovereign nation in three weeks time the source said on saturday downing street had said the government had a

victory ending a desperate attempt to get legal issues rejected by state and federal judges before the nation s highest court and subvert the will of voters the high court s order was a stark repudiation of a legal claim that was widely regarded as dubious yet embraced by the president republican state attorneys general and house republicans trump had insisted the court would find the wisdom and courage to adopt his baseless position that the election was the product of widespread fraud and should be overturned but the nation s highest court emphatically disagreed friday s order marked the second time this week that the court had rebuffed republican requests that it get involved in the election outcome and reject the voters choice as expressed in an election regarded by both republican and democratic officials as free and fair the justices turned away an appeal from pennsylvania republicans on tuesday on monday the electoral college meets to formally elect biden as the next president trump had called the lawsuit filed by texas against georgia michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin the big one that would end with the supreme court undoing biden s substantial electoral college majority and allowing trump to serve another four years in the white house in a brief order the court said texas does not have the legal right to sue those states because it has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections justices samuel alito and clarence thomas who have said previously the court does not have the authority to turn away lawsuits between states said they would have heard texas complaint but they would not have done as texas wanted setting aside those four states electoral votes for biden pending resolution of the lawsuit white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said the justices dodged they hid behind procedure none of those justices gave a view on the facts of the case appearing friday night on fox news channel s hannity mcenany said the legal fight would continue in state courts three trump appointees sit on the high court in his push to get the most recent of his nominees justice amy coney barrett confirmed quickly trump said she would be needed for any post election lawsuits barrett appears to have participated in both cases this week none of the trump appointees noted a dissent in either case the four states sued by texas had urged the court to reject the case as meritless they were backed by another states and the district of columbia republican support for the lawsuit and its call to throw out millions of votes in four battleground states was rooted in baseless claims of fraud an extraordinary display of the party s willingness to countermand the will of voters house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california and minority whip steve scalise of louisiana were among those joining to support the action the court has rightly dismissed out of hand the extreme unlawful and undemocratic gop lawsuit to overturn the will of millions of american voters house speaker nancy pelosi said friday night a few republicans expressed concerns about the case many others remained silent even as trump endlessly repeated claims that he lost a chance at a second term due to widespread fraud sen ben sasse a nebraska republican who has previously criticized the president applauded the court s decision since election night a lot of people have been confusing voters by spinning kenyan birther type chavez rigged the election from the grave conspiracy theories but every american who cares about the rule of law should take comfort that the supreme court including all three of president trump s picks closed the book on the nonsense sasse said in a statement pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro said the court saw through this seditious abuse of the judicial process while these stunts are legally insignificant their cost to our country in misleading the public about a free and fair election and in tearing at our constitution is high and we will not tolerate them from our sister states or anyone else said shapiro a democrat breaking texas vs pennsylvania has been denied by the supreme court our nation s highest court saw through this seditious abuse of our electoral process this swift denial should make anyone contemplating further attacks on our election think twice pic twitter com ljlakcqm the texas complaint repeated false disproven and unsubstantiated accusations about the voting in four states that went for trump s democratic challenger the high court had never before been asked for such a dramatic remedy two days after texas attorney general ken paxton filed his suit trump jumped into the high court case hours later the president held a meeting at the white house scheduled before the suit was filed with a dozen republican attorneys general including paxton and several others who backed the effort if the supreme court shows great wisdom and courage the american people will win perhaps the most important case in history and our electoral process will be respected again he tweeted friday afternoon trump had spent the week relentlessly tweeting about the texas case with the hashtag overturn and claiming falsely that he had won the election but was robbed if the supreme court shows great wisdom and courage the american people will win perhaps the most important case in history and our electoral process will be respected again in a statement friday paxton called the supreme court s decision unfortunate still some of the top state republican prosecutors who urged the court to get involved acknowledged that the effort was a long shot and sought to distance themselves from trump s baseless allegations of fraud the case inflamed already high tensions over the election west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey said his office staff received two death threats thursday after he signed onto the brief supporting the case the lawsuit also divided officials in some states montana attorney general tim fox supported texas case even though he said the suit was belated and its chances are slim at best fox said the case raised important constitutional questions about the separation of powers and the integrity of mail in ballots in those defendant states but gov steve bullock d mont urged the court to reject the case he said the fact that texas is not suing montana which trump won even though the state similarly used mail in ballots underscores that this action is less about election integrity than it is about attempting to overturn the will of the electorate trump s repetition of election related falsehoods and conspiracy theories has taken hold among far right media and much of his base many republican voters in several states won by biden have demanded that their elected officials find a way to invalidate the president elect s victories the republican party of texas on friday evening issued a statement raising the far fetched possibility of secession perhaps law abiding states should bond together and form a union of states that will abide by the constitution said party chairman allen west the former florida congressman even though the court s action seemed to be the end of the road for trump s legal fights about the election results the president s efforts may have a destabilizing effect long after he leaves office trump s personal attorney rudy giuliani vowed friday to keep fighting some litigation may continue but it will not change election results said rick hasen a law professor at the universtiy of california irvine the delegitimization of the biden presidency by trump and of elections generally will reverberate for years to come and

networks have revolutionised how we access information in france over a quarter of people get their news from social networks second only to television and for young people the change is even more drastic of the under s say their primary source of information is social media ifop and we re not just passive consumers of information online now everyone can also generate content leading to a vast quantity of news and views online sifting through that ever growing mountain of information forces search engines and social media to use algorithms to sort the wheat they think will interest us from the chaff they assume won t for j r me duberry of the university of geneva it s a simple calculation if a web user has a given profile then they will be fed information of a certain type posts that seem to appear at random on our twitter or facebook timelines are in fact carefully chosen according to what the platform already knows about us interests friends likes highlighting content that is tailored specifically to our interests filters out topics from outside our comfort zone reinforcing our beliefs online rights are human rights but social networks are only one aspect of the digital echo chambers search engines are also key once again due to their reliance on algorithms google s search results are generated from our own online history mixed with that of thousands of other users the goal for the search engine is to maximise user engagement by finding results that are most likely to prompt interest and sales from the user and so generate advertising revenue for j r me duberry those gatekeepers limit our access to knowledge it s as if there was someone standing in front of the university library who asks you a bunch of questions about who you are and only then gives you access to a limited number of books and you never get the chance to see all the books on offer and you never know the criteria for those limits the consequences of these so called filter bubbles are far reaching for tristan mend s france specialist in digital cultures at the university of paris being informed via social networks means an internet user is in a closed circuit of information blinkered online views democratic bad news for many academics those echo chambers could threaten the health of our democracies suggesting the algorithms could contribute to the polarisation of society by limiting our access to views similar to our own and excluding contradictory opinions our beliefs may be reinforced but at the expense of a diversity of opinions and that could undermine the very basis of our democracies for jer me duberry the filter bubbles could lead to us questioning the value of a vote today we lend a great deal of importance to the vote which is the extension of a person s opinion but that individual s opinion is targeted by interest groups using an impressive array of techniques that isn t the only distortion that algorithms have created they have also allowed more radical views to predominate youtube s algorithm is blind to the actual content of a video its choice of what will be most visible is made according to which videos are viewed all the way to the end but for tristan mend s france it is generally the most activist or militant internet users that view videos all the way through that provokes extra visibility for otherwise marginal content at the expense of more nuanced or balanced views or indeed verified information escaping the echo chamber so what happens to the spirit of debate in a world where your online habits reinforce your beliefs is the echo chamber a philosophical prison and how easy is it to get back out into the fresh air of contradictory views in the us the movement opposing algorithms is gaining pace since the senate has been debating the filter bubble transparency act a bipartisan bill to allow webusers to search online without being manipulated by algorithms driven by user specific data and twitter has already taken

macron faces accusations that he is moving to curtail the civic rights in his country and reduce transparency the recent state visit of egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi underscored france s longstanding willingness to turn a blind eye to systemic oppression in the countries it sells weapons to when sisi came to france for a state visit this week less than a month after prominent human rights workers in egypt were arrested and slapped with terrorism related charges following a meeting with french and other european diplomats human rights watch called for arms sales to egypt to stop and activists were looking to french president emmanuel macron to make a strong statement they had perhaps reason to be hopeful after the november arrests the french foreign ministry issued a statement expressing its deep concern about developments in the arab nation france maintains a frank exacting dialogue with egypt on human rights issues including individual cases the statement said in the end not only were activists disappointed by macron s reception of sisi they were outraged by it far from taking a firm line on abuses and demanding that egypt do better if it hoped to continue receiving military aid macron went out of his way to disassociate the purchase of arms with the respect of human rights i will not condition matters of defence and economic cooperation on these disagreements over human rights macron said in a press conference it is more effective to have a policy of demanding dialogue than a boycott that would only reduce the effectiveness of one of our partners in the fight against terrorism the whole way he framed the human rights debate in the press conference was horrific said timothy kaldas nonresident fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy arresting human rights workers and oppressing egyptians is not fighting terrorism quite the contrary a double standard macron s stance was particularly salient given that his own government has been under fire over a proposed security law that critics charge would limit civic liberties in france at the same time that he has defended france s commitment to freedom of speech in the wake of the killing of a teacher who showed his class caricatures of the prophet mohammed macron called the teacher samuel paty a quiet hero dedicated to preserving french values macron s position with sisi this week was notably softer than the one he took in january when he told his egyptian counterpart that security could not be considered separately from human rights noting that oppression jeopardises stability rather than enhance it it s a double standard said rim sarah alouane a researcher in public law university toulouse capitole we are in the middle of this hypocrisy about how we are supposed to be the country of the enlightenment of human rights we are supposed to have basically created human rights and yet we have no problem making deals with the devil and closing our eyes to what should be the most important thing the protection of the human kaldas agreed macron will be adamant about how much france cherishes its values in one context and then be completely unwilling to prioritise those values in his relations with authoritarians marcon has shown himself similarly willing to ignore abuses in other parts of the region as well when several european countries including germany called for the suspension of arms sales to saudi arabia after the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi macron dismissed those concerns as demagoguery saying the weapons had nothing to do with the murder i understand the connection with what s happening in yemen but there is no link with mister khashoggi he said saudi arabia leads a coalition that has been engaged in a war in yemen that has had devastating effects on the humanitarian situation there the only reason macron cites yemen is to dismiss the other argument but then he continues to provide the arms that fuel the war in yemen kaldas said key to sovereignty france has a vested interest in batting away the issue of rights abuses arms sales are big business for the country which is third in global military exports coming behind the united states and russia the defence sector in france employs people roughly percent of the total industrial workforce according to a report by the country s parliament france is one of the few countries in the world capable of independently producing advanced military systems and arms sales are key to the survival of the defence sector it s important for france to maintain its own arms industry both to be a significant player on the world stage and to be self sufficient said pieter d wezeman senior researcher in the arms and military expenditure programme at the stockholm international peace research institute to be able to do that you need to have export clients because otherwise you won t be able to afford it as minister of the armed forces florence

looked to be hanging in the balance on friday after leaders on both sides of the channel gave a gloomy assessment of progress in last gasp talks british prime minister boris johnson and eu commission president ursula von der leyen have given their negotiators until sunday before a decision is made on whether to keep talking or give up the mood worsened after von der leyen told eu leaders at a marathon brussels summit there were low expectations and the probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal the republic of ireland and germany tried to raise spirits agreeing that a pact was difficult but still possible how revolutionary conservatives made state aid the crux of brexit drama but johnson said it was looking very very likely that britain would end up dealing with its biggest single trading partner on world trade organization wto terms from the new year if there s a big offer a big change in what they the eu are saying then i must say that i ve yet to see it he told reporters in blyth northeast england the comments did nothing to inspire confidence in the british pound which extended its losses on currency markets dropping more than one percent against the dollar traders are turning their back on the pound as the language being used now is more serious and a fears of a no deal have increased considerably cmc markets analyst david madden told afp uk chief negotiator david frost and his eu counterpart michel barnier are trying to carveout a deal by sunday with just three weeks left until the end of a transition period following britain s departure from the bloc in january last minute turnaround whatever happens britain will leave the eu single market and customs union leading to the re introduction of border checks for the first time in decades that has already raised the prospect of heavy traffic clogging roads leading to seaports in southern and southeast england as bureaucracy lengthens waiting times for imports and exports logjams at the felixstowe container port in eastern england and elsewhere have already raised fears of more to come and delays to deliveries to shops businesses and industry but johnson s spokesman said they were mainly caused by a global spike in demand for consumer goods and the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on shipping patterns and container capacity brexit trade talks have been deadlocked over the extent of eu access to british fishing grounds and rules governing fair competition an eu official refused to rule out a last minute turnaround for a deal even after the bloc published no deal contingency planning in what was seen as a warning shot to britain johnson again said fishing and the so called level playing field were key issues in particular a ratchet clause that would bind britain to match any future eu legislation analysts say that a desire to pivot to the left on the economy getting out of eu state aid rules to allow westminster to dole out subsidies to uk businesses is behind the move to get britain out of level playing field rules von der leyen told a post summit news conference the proposed equivalence rules would not be compulsory and britain could act as it sees fit we would simply adapt the conditions for access to our market accordingly she added johnson s spokesman said that would still leave britain tied to decisions made in brussels australia terms johnson won a snap election a year ago on saturday with the promise of an oven ready brexit deal that would break years of political deadlock since britain voted in to exit the eu but he has been under pressure to make good on his promise including from working class towns like blyth who were won over to his ruling conservatives after voting for brexit johnson s assessment that britain would prosper mightily on wto rules with the eu what he calls australia terms has not been universally welcomed tariffs and quotas would drive up the cost of business that would be passed on to consumers in

president abdel fattah al sisi underscored france s longstanding willingness to turn a blind eye to systemic oppression in the countries it sells weapons to when sisi came to france for a state visit this week less than a month after prominent human rights workers in egypt were arrested and slapped with terrorism related charges following a meeting with french and other european diplomats human rights watch called for arms sales to egypt to stop and activists were looking to french president emmanuel macron to make a strong statement they had perhaps reason to be hopeful after the november arrests the french foreign ministry issued a statement expressing its deep concern about developments in the arab nation france maintains a frank exacting dialogue with egypt on human rights issues including individual cases the statement said in the end not only were activists disappointed by macron s reception of sisi they were outraged by it far from taking a firm line on abuses and demanding that egypt do better if it hoped to continue receiving military aid macron went out of his way to disassociate the purchase of arms with the respect of human rights i will not condition matters of defence and economic cooperation on these disagreements over human rights macron said in a press conference it is more effective to have a policy of demanding dialogue than a boycott that would only reduce the effectiveness of one of our partners in the fight against terrorism the whole way he framed the human rights debate in the press conference was horrific said timothy kaldas nonresident fellow at the tahrir institute for middle east policy arresting human rights workers and oppressing egyptians is not fighting terrorism quite the contrary a double standard macron s stance was particularly salient given that his own government has been under fire over a proposed security law that critics charge would limit civic liberties in france at the same time that he has defended france s commitment to freedom of speech in the wake of the killing of a teacher who showed his class caricatures of the prophet mohammed macron called the teacher samuel paty a quiet hero dedicated to preserving french values macron s position with sisi this week was notably softer than the one he took in january when he told his egyptian counterpart that security could not be considered separately from human rights noting that oppression jeopardises stability rather than enhance it it s a double standard said rim sarah alouane a researcher in public law university toulouse capitole we are in the middle of this hypocrisy about how we are supposed to be the country of the enlightenment of human rights we are supposed to have basically created human rights and yet we have no problem making deals with the devil and closing our eyes to what should be the most important thing the protection of the human kaldas agreed macron will be adamant about how much france cherishes its values in one context and then be completely unwilling to prioritise those values in his relations with authoritarians marcon has shown himself similarly willing to ignore abuses in other parts of the region as well when several european countries including germany called for the suspension of arms sales to saudi arabia after the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi macron dismissed those concerns as demagoguery saying the weapons had nothing to do with the murder i understand the connection with what s happening in yemen but there is no link with mister khashoggi he said saudi arabia leads a coalition that has been engaged in a war in yemen that has had devastating effects on the humanitarian situation there the only reason macron cites yemen is to dismiss the other argument but then he continues to provide the arms that fuel the war in yemen kaldas said key to sovereignty france has a vested interest in batting away the issue of rights abuses arms sales are big business for the country which is third in global military exports coming behind the united states and russia the defence sector in france employs people roughly percent of the total industrial workforce according to a report by the country s parliament france is one of the few countries in the world capable of independently producing advanced military systems and arms sales are key to the survival of the defence sector it s important for france to maintain its own arms industry both to be a significant player on the world stage and to be self sufficient said pieter d wezeman senior researcher in the arms and military expenditure programme at the stockholm international peace research institute to be able to do that you need to have export clients because otherwise you won t be able to afford it as minister of the armed forces florence parly put it in arms exports are the business model of our sovereignty and the industry is growing arms sales can vary widely from year to year so researchers look at extended periods of time comparing the years with french arms exports grew percent representing percent of the global arms market over the past decade the middle east has accounted for roughly percent of french exports said guy anderson associate director of the industry and markets division at jane s publisher of jane s defence weekly france has been very prolific in providing weapons to a wide range of people wezeman said france has been known to ignore arms embargos as well in his autobiography no room for small dreams the late israeli politician shimon perez said that france secretly sold weapons to israel back in the s when few nations would and it was the french who gave israel its nuclear capacities perez wrote the illicit arms sales have continued the french found ways to supply weapons to the apartheid regime in south africa despite restrictions on such exports and press reports said that military material found in libya in indicated that france had violated the arms embargo there france is one of the least scrupulous arms sellers on earth said kaldas even the us is a little more restrictive about their arms sales daily newsletterreceive essential international

enforcement and heightened scrutiny of the country s police watchdog the igpn which critics say is hamstrung by a lack of independence in june of this year at the height of protests against violence and racism in the police france s outgoing human rights ombudsman raised the alarm over a crisis of public confidence in the security forces in a wide ranging report that made for grim reading in a parting shot after five years in the job jacques toubon urged a reversal of what he described as a warring mentality that has driven a wedge between the police and the public he denounced a culture of impunity in the force lamenting the lack of accountability in french law enforcement long standing grievances over french policing returned to the fore in recent weeks following a string of high profile incidents and a hugely controversial government proposal that critics say will make it more difficult to document cases of police abuse the incidents which included the brutal clearing of a migrant camp in paris and the beating of black music producer michel zecler have heightened scrutiny of the inspection g n rale de la police nationale igpn the police s widely criticised internal disciplinary body amid a fierce backlash that has seen tens of thousands rally in cities across the country calling for greater police accountability government members including the hardline interior minister g rald darmanin have been forced to concede shortcomings in the igpn and examine ways to reform the police watchdog accountable to the top cop according to mathieu zagrodzki a researcher at the university of versailles saint quentin the igpn s problems stem largely from a concurrent deficit of independence and public trust there s widespread suspicion that the agency does not carry out its investigations as thoroughly and diligently as it should zagrodzki explained in an interview with france as a result there s a lack of public trust in the watchdog he added a lot of people don t even bother complaining to the igpn because they figure it is pointless when it comes to cases of police brutality the igpn is routinely accused of downplaying the facts and siding with the police critics point to a flawed structure that inherently creates bias the agency s head is directly appointed by and accountable to the interior minister who is frequently referred to as the premier flic de france the top cop racism sex abuse and impunity french police s toxic legacy in the suburbs it s not just the leadership that is exposed to accusations of bias the entire agency is largely composed of police officers in they accounted for percent of its staff members you essentially have police officers investigating other officers that s why people are suspicious of the igpn because they sense that abuses are settled in private jean michel schlosser a sociologist at the university of reims who formerly served in the police told france brigitte jullien the current head of the igpn has vehemently rejected criticism of her agency describing it as an insult to the ethics and professionalism of her colleagues in june days after the release of toubon s report she assured that the disciplinary body was dreaded by all officers in france all professions whether lawyers doctors or journalists have internal control mechanisms and they never get criticised jullien told french media claiming that her agency is no less independent than others no power to punish founded more than a century ago the igpn performs a number of duties with limited powers and resources it inspects police services evaluates practices and rules of engagement and investigates complaints of abuse as schlosser said it can make recommendations but does not have the power to punish igpn investigations are either administrative or judicial administrative inquiries can be requested by the national police chief the interior minister or the prefect the local head of police in judicial investigations on the other hand the agency can act on its own initiative or at the request of prosecutors and magistrates ordinary citizens can also petition the disciplinary body via an online platform though it is not obliged to act upon their complaints the trouble said schlosser is that the igpn s powers are strictly curtailed during administrative inquiries it can do little more than oblige officers to face questioning which often results in a highly incomplete investigation the sociologist explains in contrast judicial inquiries offer the igpn much greater latitude it can issue search warrants for instance and is only accountable to a magistrate according to its latest annual report the police inspectorate completed judicial investigations in a further administrative inquiries were carried out leading to sanction proposals while the report does not specify how many of those proposals actually led to penalties it notes that igpn recommended sanctions accounted for just percent of all punishments meted out by the police a french exception as critics are quick to point out france s police watchdog differs considerably from its counterparts elsewhere in europe both in its composition and its assignments sebastien roch a political analyst and police expert compared the french model with the practice in countries including the united kingdom denmark finland and the netherlands in those countries roch told french weekly t l rama t he first thing the authorities did was to appoint a magistrate not a police officer to head their police watchdogs schlosser noted that police watchdogs in such countries are headed by independent figures who are often appointed by local legislatures they operate as independent administrative authorities and are not answerable to the interior ministry furthermore their investigators are not police officers but most often legal experts and magistrates schlosser added police officers are present in a consultative capacity based on their knowledge of their job he pointed to the case of the independent office for police conduct iopc in england and wales as emblematic of this culture of independence the iopc s director is legally required to have never worked for the police its investigative units are mixed including retired officers who never make up more than a quarter of staff and legal experts the advantage with such a system is that you get a comprehensive understanding of situations said zagrodzki on the one hand there s the police officer who knows the system and is familiar with procedural matters and on the other you get the perspective from the outside that way an action that may seem proportionate to officers can be flagged as socially unacceptable in a democracy greater autonomy within the interior ministry in its most recent month report relating to the iopc registered a total of complaints from members of the public more than three times the number recorded by france s igpn over the same period it s a significant discrepancy for countries with comparable population sizes one that experts attribute to different cultures of interaction with the public uk police officers are no more violent than their french counterparts zagrodzki observes the difference is that there is far greater trust in the institution in england and wales meaning people are more inclined to file complaints he says appointing an independent head of the igpn an idea recently mooted by french prime minister jean castex would mark a step in the right direction though it would not be enough to change the culture of the french watchdog changing the leadership alone will not alter the structure of the agency even though it could improve its image and encourage people to step forward with their complaints he explains for substantive change to take place zagrodzky added the entire igpn would need to become an independent body a move the french government is unlikely to push for challenged on the subject in an interview last week president emmanuel macron advocated greater transparency in investigations and more scope for the igpn to penalise malpractice however he remained vague on the subject of the watchdog s institutional independence suggesting it should remain closely linked to police authorities and its tutelary minister top cop darmanin this article was adapted from the

to new lows this week as the countries heads of state engaged in the latest bout of vitriol that had all the colour and spectacle of a ringside sport french president emmanuel macron has been caught up in a series of verbal spats with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan in recent months as diplomatic ties between them continue to fray at the core of escalating animosities is a host of issues including what erdogan defines as french islamophobia energy disputes in the eastern mediterranean and military support in libya but on friday the acrimony reached febrile proportions as erdogan called on the french to dump their leader at the ballot box in when macron is expected to seek re election my wish is for france to get rid of the macron trouble as soon as possible erdogan said macron fired back calling for respect during an interview with the news site brut saying erdogan was curtailing the freedoms of the turkish people dr ian lesser vice president and executive director at the german marshall fund said erdogan s resorting to diplomatic barbs is nothing new as he has a tendency to use his own rhetoric as part of his foreign policy the friction between france and turkey is partly driven by personality dr lesser said in some ways erdogan takes this quite personally as he s increasingly disenchanted with the west and turkey s place in it and he sees france and its leadership embodying all that he dislikes in europe culturally politically geopolitically erdogan s latest invective against macron comes ahead of a crucial eu summit on december in which france is expected to lead the push for sanctions against turkey for violating greek waters to search for gas or breaching a un arms embargo on libya the strongman has long aspired to join the table of his european counterparts as a member of the eu and once seemed willing to do whatever the eu asked to get there turkey even agreed to be the gatekeeper in a crucial deal for the eu to stem the number of migrants entering europe but the prize of eu membership may be losing its appeal some critics see erdogan s verbal lashings against macron and the eu as deliberate provocations a way of burnishing his image among nationalistic turks who see their president as a defender of islamic values there s a tendency globally for leaders to personalise relationships trump and putin were examples of this and erdogan has been another dr lesser said at a certain level personality matters but combined with intense nationalism as seen in turkey and elsewhere the rhetoric has taken on a particularly edgy character erdogan calls for french boycott erdogan inflamed tensions with macron when he became the self appointed voice of the islamic world in the aftermath of terror attacks against france in october in a suburb of paris teacher samuel paty was beheaded by an year old islamist for showing students cartoons of the prophet mohammad in a civics lesson on free speech this was followed days later by a church attack in nice in which a radicalised man armed with a large knife killed three people as france emerged from its collective grief macron urged the french to rally behind the republic s values of secularism or la cit in defiance of attacks by radicalised elements but his impassioned speech caused a furore when he said that islam was in crisis all over the world today erdogan s retort was swift and personal saying macron needed to get his mental health checked the turkish leader fanned the flames of dissent by accusing france of being constitutionally islamophobic and called on muslims everywhere to boycott french goods he sought solidarity too with fellow muslims in france who he said were subjected to a lynch campaign similar to that against jews in europe before world war ii while effigies of macron burned in pakistan egypt and iran elsewhere in the arab world erdogan s rallying cry mostly fell flat french authorities denounced erdogan s words as turkish propaganda against france and immediately recalled its ambassador to turkey for talks burnishing images at home aside from the role of personality in fuelling the current animosities between the two headstrong leaders there is also a desire to boost support at home in each other macron and erdogan have found the ideal enemy asli aydintasbas a fellow at the european council on foreign relations told the washington post this spat works for both leaders in some strange fashion both domestically and in terms of the influence they are trying to project abroad even with an incoming us biden administration which will likely take a more active role in international affairs including in regards to europe it may not be enough to encourage erdogan to rein in his attacks against macron erdogan is a skilful politician who has made the journey from liberal reformist to something tougher minded and authoritarian dr lesser said there s a very small price to pay inside turkey for an outspoken stance against france and europe it s a political plus for erdogan because the mood of nationalism is widely shared even by the opposition macron may also be somewhat driven by domestic motivations his fierce defence of secularism following recent terror attacks and attempts to better integrate the practice of islam into french culture may help his chances of re election if he s to face far right leader marine le pen in when it comes to france s larger relationship with the muslim world turkey is going to be part of the calculus when it comes to french policy dr lesser said as

victory by france s green party europe cologie les verts eelv in countrywide municipal elections when he created the citizens council macron vowed its proposals would be put to parliament unfiltered and eventually transformed into executive decrees or serve as the basis for a referendum and in june when the council presented its recommendations after nine months of work the president announced that he accepted nearly all of them of the proposals made the president has decided to keep he will submit them either to the government the parliament or to the french people said a statement on the lys e palace website on monday just days before the december anniversary of the paris climate agreement government ministers met with parliament members and representatives of the ccc for two days of meetings around the subjects discussed by the council housing transportation consumption food production and employment in order to present the points that were adopted sources who had received the invitation were quoted as saying by afp it is a matter of presenting them with the initial long awaited considerations of how their proposals will be translated before the text is presented to the cabinet said the office of environment minister barbara pompili but members of the citizens council expressed concern over the final wording of the legislation after the government suggested that the scope of several measures would be limited or delayed in particular due to the crisis that has hit polluting sectors such as automotive and aviation particularly hard it would have been good to have

dion wrote in his petition but discreetly the government is now in the process of undoing and weakening a significant number of measures before presenting them formally to parliament members or to the

some of the points needed to be discussed further i don t need to be lectured to on climate macron said listing some of the issues that his government has tackled no one has done as much as this government has in three years he insisted on the great respect he had for the work of the citizens convention but added you can t say that because citizens wrote something it s the bible or the koran

president did point out the seriousness of our proposals what i did retain is that not everything has been decided we will present ideas and if we can weigh in we will he was quoted by afp as saying dion feeling targeted by macron on friday shot back with an open letter in the daily le monde on saturday reminding the president of his promises for this democratic initiative to work it is essential

sleepless night she said five years after the paris agreement the eu wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming yet the bloc s leaders were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in october mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition but the long awaited deal on a massive long term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched thursday by eu leaders swung the momentum large swaths of the record high trillion euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help

so challenging that the international rescue committee said it was still trying to confirm details around the killing of a colleague in the hitsats refugee camp in shire town the base of aid operations separately the danish refugee council said three staffers who worked as guards at a project site were killed last month it was not clear where but the group also supports the eritrean

on friday ethiopia said it had begun delivering aid to areas in tigray under its control including shire and mekele a city of a half million people suggestions that humanitarian assistance is impeded due to active military combat in several cities and surrounding areas within the tigray region is untrue and undermines the critical work undertaken by the national defense forces to stabilize the

potential covid vaccine won t be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot s effectiveness in older people the companies said early trials showed the vaccine produced an insufficient immune response in people over because it didn t contain enough of the material that triggers the production of disease fighting antibodies they said they plan to reformulate the vaccine and do more testing which is likely to delay approval to the fourth quarter of from the middle of the year the results of the study are not as we hoped roger connor president of london based gsk vaccines said in a statement the delay is a setback for plans to vaccinate large numbers of people around the world amid a pandemic that has already taken more than million lives gsk and sanofi plan to produce up to billion doses of their covid vaccine annually and they have signed agreements to supply millions of doses to the u s european union canada and developing countries the difficulties underscore the challenges scientists face as they race to develop covid vaccines condensing a process that usually takes years into a matter of months researchers in australia said friday they were abandoning their own vaccine candidate because it produced false positive results to hiv tests how can we apply lessons from the spanish flu s second wave to covid public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people dr penny ward a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at king s college london said the setback is even more significant because sanofi is a leading producer of flu vaccines and has large scale manufacturing capacity the delay will impact their ability to make the millions of doses that have been pre ordered because they have to sort out this dose response effect question she said very unfortunate i would say a vaccine produced by u s drugmaker pfizer and german partner biontech has been authorized for widespread use in the u k and a handful of other countries a u s government advisory panel on thursday endorsed use of the pfizer vaccine putting the country one step away from launching its own mass vaccination program sanofi and gsk confirmed that volunteers in their study received less of the vaccine than intended because of incorrect readings produced by two of the commercial compounds used to test the amount of active ingredient in each dose the lower dose was enough to produce a good immune response in younger people but the response was much weaker in those over they said the manufacturing problem was first reported by stat a website that focuses on health and medical news sanofi and gsk said their research to date makes them confident the vaccine will ultimately be successful in adults to the vaccine produced an immune response comparable to patients who had recovered from covid the companies said citing results from the early stage trials in addition sanofi and gsk have now tested a reformulated version of the vaccine on non human primates those tests showed that the vaccine protected against lung damage and reduced the amount of virus in the nose and lungs in two to four days the companies plan to start a new early stage trial of the vaccine in february that study will compare the immune response in volunteers who get the sanofi gsk vaccine with the response in others who receive an already approved vaccine if those results are positive they plan to start a large scale trial to prove the vaccine s safety and effectiveness in the second quarter we have identified the path forward and remain confident and committed to bringing a safe and efficacious covid vaccine said thomas triomphe head of sanofi s vaccine unit no single pharma company can make it alone he added the world needs more than one vaccine to fight the pandemic how long will social distancing last meanwhile researchers at the university of queensland and australian biopharmaceutical company csl said friday that they would not move forward with their own vaccine candidate because a protein in the shot triggered false positive results for hiv follow up tests confirmed that no hiv was present the researchers said the vaccine had proven safe and produced a robust response to covid during phase one trials researchers said in a statement while it would have been possible to re engineer the vaccine to avoid the problem with false positives this would have taken too much time in the midst of the pandemic they said doing so would set back development by another or so months and while this is a tough decision to take the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone s

" uk regulators have issued precautionary advice after two british healthcare workers developed a severe allergic reaction to the new covid vaccine from pfizer and biontech scientists have been quick to reassure the public that the vaccine is safe saying that while reactions to new vaccines can occur severe reactions are rare the british vaccination campaign against covid had barely begun when it hit its first snag on december two staff working for the british national health service nhs had an allergic reaction after they received the vaccine developed by pfizer in collaboration with biontech both were treated quickly and were recovering well authorities in the uk confirmed the uk medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency has since issued a precautionary warning advising people not to get inoculated with the pfizer vaccine if they have a history of acute allergic reactions an advisory panel of us experts said thursday they would follow britain s lead with an allergy warning after recommending emergency approval there for the pfizer vaccine a rare side effect this is appropriate advice dr louisa james an immunology researcher at queen mary university in london told france we now know that the two people concerned had a medical history and carried treatment to deal with strong allergic reactions the two healthcare workers were carrying anapen an emergency treatment of adrenaline injected into the body in case of anaphylactic shock which manifests as a severe allergic reaction according to allergy uk one in people is at risk of anaphylactic shock after exposure to an allergen they have a sensitivity to this type of allergic response affects the cardiovascular respiratory and gastrointestinal systems and causes severe skin rashes the blood pressure can drop and breathing can become difficult professor saad shakir director of the drug safety research unit a british health ngo said in an interview with the science media centre website in the case of the two nhs workers however neither had anaphylaxis which is a more extreme reaction that can even be fatal it appears to be an anaphylactoid or pseudo anaphylactic reaction which leads to similar but less severe symptoms professor shakir explained anaphylactoid reactions are linked to certain foods or medicines but also vaccines including the annual flu jab cases of severe allergic reactions have been reported for all vaccines but they remain rare nilsson lennart a researcher at the link ping allergy centre in sweden and the author of a study on vaccines and allergies told france he added that cases of anaphylactic shock typically occur at a rate of for every one million doses of vaccine administered finding the cause the pharmaceutical industry widely recognises the risk of allergic reaction and pfizer knew it existed in the case of its covid vaccine the data published by the laboratory indicate that about of patients had some form of allergic reaction after administration of the dose during phase three clinical trials said professor stephen evans a pharmacoepidemiology researcher in the department of medical statistics at the school of hygiene and tropical medicine in london pinpointing exactly what led to the allergic reaction may have its challenges as the pfizer vaccine employs completely new technology with no precedent for comparison yet investigations may lead to an additive commonly used in older vaccines these kinds of side effects are known to be possibly linked to ingredients used to stabilise vaccines such as polyethylene glycol a gel used to thicken certain fluids in drugs or cosmetics dr james said indeed pfizer had disclosed it used one of these ingredients when it publicly released data on its vaccine scientists agree that what may appear as an initial mishap does not portend safety issues for the pfizer vaccine or the other contenders poised for rollout one has to remember that even things like marmite spread can cause unexpected severe allergic reactions professor evans said vaccine scepticism nonetheless remains a concern and the scientific community will have to be vigilant and transparent in its messaging on efficacy and safety if it is to mitigate vaccine hesitancy publishing data by independent scientific and medical journals is one strategy in additional data released in the new england journal of medicine on thursday pfizer and biontech said the vaccine was effective in a randomised controlled trial of more than people the journal s editors described the vaccine s development as a triumph for science with independent monitoring processes in place to advise both the scientific community and the public robust scrutiny of covid vaccine programmes should be assured and with it high levels of public
